Description
-----------

### TodoList API is a RESTful web application for task management with JWT authentication. 
### Users can create, edit, delete, and view tasks with pagination, and filter them by status ("in progress", "completed", "deadline"). 
### The API ensures security through data validation, SQL injection protection, and task access restrictions.
